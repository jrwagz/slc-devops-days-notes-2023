How Dev and Data Teams Can Improve Collaboration

Data teams end up dealing with the rush fallout from dev teams.

Rather than complain about the stuff that flow downhill, flip the mindset and take control of your destiny, rather
than just playing the victim.

Improve collaboration through empathy, and getting involved in conversations early.

Understanding what the other team does is key to having empathy and improving collaboration.

Show me the incentive, and I'll show you the outcome.

Get to know each other so that the desire to collaborate exists.  Need team building across the teams.

Consider upstream and downstream stakeholders.

Communicate regularly.

Set common notifications and alerts for upstream/downstream problems.

Address root causes of problems.
