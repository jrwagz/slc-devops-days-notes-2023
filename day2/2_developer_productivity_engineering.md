# Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE)

How do we improve feedback cycles?

How do we fix flaky tests?

Aligns with faster time to market.

It's all about reducing the cost it takes to generate more income.

If developers are delivering the same productivity in shorter amounts of time, then the business
generates more revenue.

Not only should we measure build and test times in CI, but also the time it takes to run locally.
Get the REAL experience that developers face.
