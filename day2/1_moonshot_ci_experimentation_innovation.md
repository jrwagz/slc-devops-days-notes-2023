# Challenge to get to the moon

In order to overcome this obstacle, started creating rapid prototypes, measuring results and evaluating performance.
Didn't just create one specific attempt, did many different attempts and learned from them along the way.

Doing the correct thing poorly is worth more than executing the wrong things perfectly.

## Principles for Innovation

- Engineering Forward

Include the engineers in forward level conversations, don't keep them in the backroom

- Replace assumptions with evidence

Don't argue over assumptions, that's wasting time.
Call our your assumptions, and let it be clear that they need to be properly validated.
Call our customer assumptions, validate them.
Business Assumptions about opportunities and viability.
Technical assumptions: capabilities and feasibility.

A QA engineer walks into a bar.
Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 99999999999 beers. Orders a lizard.
Orders -1 beers. Orders a ueicbksjdhd.

First real customer walks in and asks where the bathroom is. The bar bursts into flames, killing everyone.
```

Weak Evidence VS Strong Evidence

Weak: Say, Opinions, Lab, Low Involvement
Strong: Do, Facts, Real World, High Involvement

Overtime uncertainty decreases, and fidelity increases.  When uncertainty is high, test as quickly and cheaply as possible.

Building innovative products is not about doing what is safe.

- Optimize for speed of learning

- Let the teams figure it out
